A website I'm building that brings together several personal projects, improving them little by little every day. Right now, I have a section that calls The Movie DB API, and I've created my own API using Spring Boot with a React frontend. It allows users to register, delete, and view books they’ve read, as well as rate those books to keep a personal log of what they've read.

I've also added a to-do list alongside it, where users can note down tasks they want to complete. Finally, there's a messaging section where users enter their name to log in; if it matches a name in the database, they're directed to their inbox where they can see messages sent to them by others.

Everything is still in development, and the design is simple, but I’m improving it whenever I have time.
